Thanks to @Rycko1 for helping!  \n  This is only for gear sets that do not have a glamour plate linked! It will automatically send a portrait update to the server, when you update the gear set.\n- Fixed: The reset button should now properly reset the portrait to the initial state of the *current* portrait.",
