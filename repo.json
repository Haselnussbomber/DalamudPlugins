    "Changelog": "New Tweak: Auto-open Recipe (Experimental)\n\nWhen a quest progresses and the new quest step requires an item that can be crafted, and you have all the materials for that item in your inventory, this tweak will automatically open the recipe.\n\nI marked this as experimental because I'm still not 100% sure about some things and have only tested it with a few quests so far (Loporrit daily quests).\n\nEnhanced Material List\n\n- Added: Option to enable the \"Search for Item by Crafting Method\" context menu entry. No more need to open the recipe tree first.\n- Fixed: When Zone Names are enabled, it now removes new lines from item names so they can fit in one line.\n\nDTR\n\n- Fixed: It still sometimes didn't display the right instance or busy status, for example after logging out and back in, so I got mad and removed caching of values altogether. Now it just reads the values on each frame.\n\nSearch the markets\n\n- Added: Automatically closes the Search Results window when starting a new search.",
