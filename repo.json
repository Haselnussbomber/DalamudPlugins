No more `/bgm` macro. Works in cutscenes.\n\nNew Tweak: Gear Set Grid\n\nA window that displays a grid view of all the items in each gear set, making it easier to figure out which items to upgrade next.  \nThis is not meant to be a replacement for the Gear Set List window, but rather a supplement to it.\n\nCommands\n\n- Added: New Command `/whatbarding`  \n  Target a players chocobo companion and execute the command to see what barding it is wearing.\n\nPortrait Helper\n\n- Fixed: The notification that the gear does not match the portrait did not show up when you were outside of a sanctuary.",
