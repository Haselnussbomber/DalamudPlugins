This makes it easier to figure out where to accept the leves.\n  - *Note:* The game sheets don't contain any information about the issuer of a leve. This is server-side only and the reason why I used the leve client instead. Now I added issuer information based on data from the Gamer Escape wiki and will have to update the list with each expansion. Ô∏è  \n  If you encounter any problems, please report them. I don't use the plugin much myself at the moment. ",
