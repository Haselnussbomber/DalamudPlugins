Sorts only when the armory is open.\n\nEnhanced Login/Logout\n\n- Added: An option \"Play emote in character selection\" (off by default). Have your character greet you with an emote!  \n  To set an emote, you'll need to log in, click the \"Change\" button, then perform the emote you want to use, and finally click the \"Stop Recording\" button.\n  > Note\n  > Emote settings are per character and not all emotes are supported (e.g. sitting or underwater emotes). What is supported, however, are alternative standing idle poses.",
