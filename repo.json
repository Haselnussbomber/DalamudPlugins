It is a slider now and supports dragging to scroll through the animation. But, two things:\n  - The flickering has not been fixed yet, as it still relies on the same game function that restart/reloads the animation at the specific timestamp.\n  - As I understand it, the end timestamp used for the slider is based on the duration of the emote, which is different from the duration of the race-specific animation. Since I can't find the actual animation duration for the life of me, we have to use the general emote duration for now.\n- Fixed: The overlays didn't update their position when the window moved.",
