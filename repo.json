    "Changelog": "Tweak reworked: Portrait Helper\n\nUpdated UI and features!\n\n- Added: A reset button has been added. This returns the portrait to the state it was in when the window was opened.\n- Added: Its now possible to save portraits into presets. Use the brand-new preset browser to load presets and organize them using tags. A double click on the preset will load it and you can drag and drop them to easily change their order or add them to tags!\n  - *Please note:* As the list of presets is shared by all tags, but filtered by the selected tag, reordering a preset will change the order across all tags.\n- Changed: The copy and paste buttons have been replaced by export and import buttons, which make use of the clipboard and export the portrait as a short base64-encoded string.\n\nEnhanced Material List\n\n- Fixed: Due to a condition check being evaluated too late, some gatherable items did not have a zone name.\n\nMaterial Allocation\n\n- Fixed: Restored a hook to correctly switch tabs when opening the window. Since v0.13.3, it looked like it changed the tabs, but it only updated the buttons, not the content.",
