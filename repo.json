This release fixes those problems.\n\nThe reason of why both version were unpublished is that I ran into a bug. It turned out that neither versions were the cause, so this is good to go. \n\n---\n\nHaselTweaks\n\n- Fixed: Tweaks were not notified when the config was updated.\n\nMaterial Allocation\n\n- Fixed: Config is now saved directly upon changing tabs.\n- Fixed: The currently selected language in the dropdown was not highlighted.\n- Fixed: Removed the language selection from the tweak config that was added there by mistake.\n\nPortrait Helper\n\n- Fixed: Stopped the maximum timestamp value from updating while the animation is loading.\n",
