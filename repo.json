    "Changelog": "- Added: A proper changelog! :D Releases will share the same format.\r\n\r\n Scrollable Tabs\r\n- Added: Support for the Bozjan Field Records window.\r\n- Added: Support for scrolling in and out of the favorites tab in the Mounts and Minions windows.\r\n- Added: Support for scrolling between the normal sized Inventory and the Key Items window.\r\n  - While at it, scrolling through tabs in Key Items window has been added, but not tested. Sorry for not having over  key items handy to have a second tab. :P\r\n- Changed: On fresh installations the Inventory option is now enabled by default.\r\n- Fixed: Scrolling too fast doesn't skip tabs anymore. Don't ask.\r\n",
